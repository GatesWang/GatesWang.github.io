   <b>Question:</b> What is the approximate value of $\sqrt{122}$<br>
   <b>Answer:</b><br>
   We try to approximate by noticing that $122 \approx 121 = 11^2$
   <br>
   	We therefore use the equation <br>
	$(11+x)^2 = 122$ <br>
	$11^2 + 2(11)(x) + x^2 = 122$ <br>
   	Since $11^2$ is the closest perfect square we know that $x<1$ <br>
	Therefore $x^2$ is relatively small and we can ignore that term <br>
	Our new equation is $11^2 + 2(11)(x) = 122$ <br>
	Solving for x yields $x = \frac{1}{2(11)} = .045$ <br>
	The true value of $\sqrt{122} = 11.0453610172$ <br>
	So the true value of $x = 0453610172$, Therefore $x^2$ is of course going to be very small. <br>
	In general this method will work for numbers that are close to perfect squares.
